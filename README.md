Day 10 - (Dated :- 30-01-25) :- I studied OOP concepts, focusing on classes, objects, and methods. I learned how classes define the structure of objects, and how methods within classes define the behaviors of those objects.  
Day 11 - (Dated :- 31-01-25) :- I studied Java constructors for object initialization, the distinction between instance and class variables, and how instance variables are object-specific while class variables are shared. I also explored access modifiers like public, private, and protected, which control the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and variables.  
Day 12 - (Dated :- 01-02-25) :- Studied about the proper format for Git commits and commit messages. For adding new changes, use the command git commit -m "[Name] Add . Commit message". When refactoring, use git commit -m "[Name] Refactor . Commit message". For fixing issues, use git commit -m "[Name] Fix . Commit message", ensuring the commit message is descriptive of the changes made.  
Day 13 - (Dated :- 03-02-25) :- I worked on understanding and applying key Java concepts. I explored the static keyword to define class-level methods and variables. I also practiced using the final keyword to create constants and prevent method or class modification. Additionally, I gained experience with the instanceof operator to check the type of an object at runtime.  
Day 14 - (Dated :- 04-02-25) :- I studied the differences between classes and objects in Java, examining class diagrams for structure, object diagrams for instances, and sequence diagrams to visualize object interactions over time.  
Day 15 - (Dated :- 05-02-25) :- I worked on understanding and applying Object-Oriented Design principles. I created Class Diagrams, Object Diagrams, and Sequence Diagrams to represent system components and their interactions effectively.

Day 17 - (Dated :- 07-02-25) :- I studied and solved problems on inheritance in Java, including single-level, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance, method overriding, constructor inheritance, polymorphism, and access modifiers. This enhanced my understanding of code reusability, dynamic behavior, and access control in inheritance.  
Day 18 - (Dated :- 10-02-25) :- Today, we solved questions on key object-oriented programming concepts, including encapsulation, which involves restricting access to object components, polymorphism that allows methods to have multiple forms, interfaces that define contracts for classes, and abstract classes that provide a blueprint for subclasses.
