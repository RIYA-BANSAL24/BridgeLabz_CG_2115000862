Day 1 - (Dated :- 18-01-25) :- I completed an assignment focused on solving basic Java problems and implementing mathematical formulas, which enhanced my problem-solving skills and understanding of Java operators. Additionally, I studied Git Bash commands and practiced essential version control operations like initializing, staging, committing, and pushing code, strengthening my technical foundation and preparing me for more advanced programming tasks.  
Day 2 - (Dated :- 20-01-25) :- I completed an assignment on basic Java problems, mathematical formulas, and Java operators. I also studied Java documentation, covering JVM, JDK, and key features. Additionally, I practiced Git Bash commands for version control operations, enhancing my technical skills.  
Day 3 - (Dated :- 21-01-25) :- I completed an assignment on basic Java problems, mathematical formulas, and Java operators. I also studied Java documentation, covering JVM, JDK, key features, and Java Programming Elements 01, 02, and 03, including topics such as comments, basic data types, variables, arithmetic operators, operator precedence, type conversion, and user input.  
Day 4 - (Dated :- 22-01-25) :- We covered essential concepts for Java Control Flows lab practices, including control flow structures, boolean data types, logical operators, conditional statements (if,else,else if), loops (for, while), break and continue statements, and switch statements. These topics are crucial for mastering control flow and decision-making in Java programming.  
Day 5 - (Dated :- 23-01-25) :- I worked on practicing key programming concepts for Java arrays. I started by understanding and creating arrays, then explored how to access them using both direct indexing and a for loop. I practiced modifying array elements and used the length property to manage the array size effectively.  
Day 6 - (Dated :- 24-01-25) :- Focused on multi-dimensional arrays, including the 2-dimensional array (matrix). I accessed and manipulated elements within these arrays, found their size, and experimented with Java's System.error() method for error messaging. Additionally, I used the exit() method to control program flow during unexpected conditions.  
Day 7 - (Dated :- 27-01-25) :- I focused on Java Methods Lab practices. I worked with user-defined methods, calling them multiple times to increase code efficiency. I also learned how to make methods more dynamic by handling varied inputs. I implemented recursive methods for solving repetitive tasks and explored Java static methods to perform operations without objects. Additionally, I utilized Java standard library methods and the `java.lang.Math` class for performing mathematical operations.  
Day 8 - (Dated :- 28-01-25) :- I focused on Java string concepts for my lab practice. I worked on creating and manipulating strings, using escape sequences like "" for special characters, and taking string inputs from users. I also explored string arrays and passed strings as method parameters. I practiced using built-in string methods and delved into understanding ASCII character codes for encoding and decoding.  
Day 9 - (Dated :- 29-01-25) :- I studied Java exceptions and their hierarchy, including the distinction between checked and unchecked exceptions. I learned about java.lang.RuntimeException and other types of exceptions, honing my skills in exception handling to manage errors efficiently in my code.  
Day 10 - (Dated :- 30-01-25) :- I studied OOP concepts, focusing on classes, objects, and methods. I learned how classes define the structure of objects, and how methods within classes define the behaviors of those objects.  
Day 11 - (Dated :- 31-01-25) :- I studied Java constructors for object initialization, the distinction between instance and class variables, and how instance variables are object-specific while class variables are shared. I also explored access modifiers like public, private, and protected, which control the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and variables.  
Day 12 - (Dated :- 01-02-25) :- Studied about the proper format for Git commits and commit messages. For adding new changes, use the command git commit -m "[Name] Add . Commit message". When refactoring, use git commit -m "[Name] Refactor . Commit message". For fixing issues, use git commit -m "[Name] Fix . Commit message", ensuring the commit message is descriptive of the changes made.  
Day 13 - (Dated :- 03-02-25) :- I worked on understanding and applying key Java concepts. I explored the static keyword to define class-level methods and variables. I also practiced using the final keyword to create constants and prevent method or class modification. Additionally, I gained experience with the instanceof operator to check the type of an object at runtime.  
Day 14 - (Dated :- 04-02-25) :- I studied the differences between classes and objects in Java, examining class diagrams for structure, object diagrams for instances, and sequence diagrams to visualize object interactions over time.  
Day 15 - (Dated :- 05-02-25) :- I worked on understanding and applying Object-Oriented Design principles. I created Class Diagrams, Object Diagrams, and Sequence Diagrams to represent system components and their interactions effectively.  
Day 16 - (Dated :- 06-02-25) :- Today was the review day; I provided my feedback and revised all study material up to week 2.  
Day 17 - (Dated :- 07-02-25) :- I studied and solved problems on inheritance in Java, including single-level, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance, method overriding, constructor inheritance, polymorphism, and access modifiers. This enhanced my understanding of code reusability, dynamic behavior, and access control in inheritance.
